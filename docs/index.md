# XenForo Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for XenForo.

## Choosing the Right Version

This documentation is version-controlled. Please select the appropriate version that matches your XenForo installation:

- [Version 2.3.6 Documentation](versions/2.3.6/index.md)
- [Version 2.0.0 Documentation](versions/2.0.0/index.md)

We maintain documentation for older versions for legacy support, and newer versions will be added as they are released.  
If you cannot find your version here, please check back later or consult the community forums.
